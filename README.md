"Null Object" Exercise
======================

In this exercise, you'll create a class following the Null Object pattern in
order to encapsulate conditional logic.

Exercise!
---------

1. Open `lib/user.rb` in your favorite editor.
2. Look for conditionals related to `nil`.
3. Introduce a Null Object. Think of a good name based on what `nil` represents
   in this context.
4. Replace a single conditional by moving the nil logic to the Null Object.
5. Repeat step four until the `nil` cases are fully encapsulated within the Null
   Object.
6. Make sure all tests pass by running `rake`.
